### One-time setup

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel-labs%2Fai-sdk-gateway-demo)

1. Clone this repository with the Deploy button above
1. Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) if you don't already have it
1. Clone the repository you created above: `git clone <repo-url>`
1. Link it to a Vercel project: `vc link` or `vc deploy`

### Usage
1. Install packages with `pnpm i` (or `npm i` or `yarn i`)
2. **Authentication Setup** - Choose one option:
   - **Option A (Recommended)**: Run `vercel env pull` to download OIDC tokens, then use `vercel dev` to start the development server
   - **Option B**: Set `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` in your environment variables (get your key from [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/dashboard/ai-gateway)), then use `pnpm dev`
   - **Note**: On Vercel deployments, OIDC authentication is automatic - no API key needed
3. (Optional) For web search functionality, add your EXA API key to your environment variables:
   - Get your API key from [Exa](https://exa.ai/)
   - Add `EXA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here` to your environment variables or `.env.local` file
4. Open http://localhost:3000 to start generating emails!

### FAQ

1. If you prefer running your local development server directly rather than using `vc dev`, you'll need to run `vc env pull` to fetch the project's OIDC authentication token locally
   1. the token expires every 12h, so you'll need to re-run this command periodically.
   1. if you use `vc dev` it will auto-refresh the token for you, so you don't need to fetch it manually
1. If you're linking to an existing, older project, you may need to enable the OIDC token feature in your project settings.
   1. visit the project settings page (rightmost tab in your project's dashboard)
   1. search for 'OIDC' in settings
   1. toggle the button under "Secure Backend Access with OIDC Federation" to Enabled and click the "Save" button

## AI SDK v6 Beta & Agent Architecture

This application showcases the new [AI SDK v6 beta](https://v6.ai-sdk.dev/docs/announcing-ai-sdk-6-beta) with the `ToolLoopAgent` class for building powerful AI agents with full control over execution flow, tool loops, and state management.
