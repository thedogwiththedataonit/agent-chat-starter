### One-time setup

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel-labs%2Fai-sdk-gateway-demo)

1. Clone this repository with the Deploy button above
1. Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) if you don't already have it
1. Clone the repository you created above: `git clone <repo-url>`
1. Link it to a Vercel project: `vc link` or `vc deploy`

### Usage
1. Install packages with `pnpm i` (or `npm i` or `yarn i`) and run the development server with `vc dev`
1. (Optional) For web search functionality, add your EXA API key to your environment variables:
   - Get your API key from [Exa](https://exa.ai/)
   - Add `EXA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here` to your environment variables or `.env.local` file
1. Open http://localhost:3000 to try the chatbot

### FAQ

1. If you prefer running your local development server directly rather than using `vc dev`, you'll need to run `vc env pull` to fetch the project's OIDC authentication token locally
   1. the token expires every 12h, so you'll need to re-run this command periodically.
   1. if you use `vc dev` it will auto-refresh the token for you, so you don't need to fetch it manually
1. If you're linking to an existing, older project, you may need to enable the OIDC token feature in your project settings.
   1. visit the project settings page (rightmost tab in your project's dashboard)
   1. search for 'OIDC' in settings
   1. toggle the button under "Secure Backend Access with OIDC Federation" to Enabled and click the "Save" button

## Chat SDK and Tool Calling

This application demonstrates the integration of the Vercel AI SDK to enable advanced chat functionalities, including tool calling within a chat UI. Tool calling allows the chatbot to interact with external APIs or custom functions based on user input, enhancing the conversational experience by providing dynamic and context-aware responses.

The standout feature is the **AI website generator** that creates production-ready websites from simple descriptions. Users can generate complete landing pages, portfolios, and business sites with modern design patterns, then iterate on them through natural conversation. 

### Available Tools

- **Website Generation**: Create complete, responsive websites with JSX and Tailwind CSS
- **Website Editing**: Modify existing generated websites with natural language instructions
- **Website Screenshot**: Capture screenshots of existing websites for design inspiration
- **Web Search**: Search the web for up-to-date information using Exa (requires `EXA_API_KEY`)
- **Real-time Preview**: View generated websites with responsive design preview (desktop/mobile)

The chat UI showcases how these capabilities can be seamlessly integrated into a user-friendly interface, allowing users to interact with AI-powered tools in real-time.
